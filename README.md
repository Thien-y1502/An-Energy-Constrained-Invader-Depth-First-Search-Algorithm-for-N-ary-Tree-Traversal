# IDFS Project

A compact repository containing the paper, LaTeX source, implementation, and test cases for the **IDFS** algorithm.

## Key Artifacts to Note

- **`IDFS-PH.zip`**  
  Archive downloaded from Overleaf. You can **re-upload it to Overleaf** to recover and edit the full LaTeX sources of the paper.  
  _Overleaf → New Project → Upload Project → select `IDFS-PH.zip`._

- **`IDFS.pdf`**  
  The compiled PDF version of the paper.

- **`ECFE/`**  
  Contains the **source code** implementing the IDFS algorithm.

- **`TestCase.docx`**  
  A collection of **test cases** used to verify whether the implementation is **correct**.

- **Other folders**  
  Provided **for reference** only; they are not required to build or run the core project.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the paper**  
   Open `IDFS.pdf` to understand the problem setting, algorithm design, and results.

2. **Edit/Rebuild the paper (optional)**  
   Upload `IDFS-PH.zip` to Overleaf to obtain the LaTeX sources, edit the content, and recompile the PDF.

3. **Explore the implementation**  
   Browse `ECFE/` to review or run the IDFS algorithm code. (See any sub-README or code comments there for language/runtime details.)

4. **Verify correctness**  
   Use `TestCase.docx` as the basis for input/output checks to confirm expected behavior.

## Notes

- Reference folders are included for background and citation; they may not be necessary for execution.
- If you reorganize directories or filenames, remember to update any build/run scripts accordingly.
